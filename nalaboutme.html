    <p>About Me
        "Hello, my name is Nalina. I am a motivated and enthusiastic individual who has a genuine passion for learning and personal growth. Over the years, I've developed a strong belief in the power of a growth mindset, which I've embraced through my journey of continuous learning and self-improvement. Inspired by Carol Dweck's book 'Mindset,' I've adopted the philosophy that challenges are opportunities for growth, and I approach them with a positive and determined attitude. welcome to my world.</p>
